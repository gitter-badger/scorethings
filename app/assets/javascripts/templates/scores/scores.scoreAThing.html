<h3>Score A Thing</h3>
<div>
    Okay, you're probably thinking <em>yeahbuhwhat?</em>.  Yes, the search below is exactly
    the same as <a ui-sref="things.search">Thing Search</a>.  I just added this page in case
    users got confused and wondered how to go about scoring a thing.  This is probably evidence of
    poor user experience (UX) design, so I might fix this in the future.
