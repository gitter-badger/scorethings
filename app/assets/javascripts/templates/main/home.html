<h1>Welcome to scorethings</h1>
<p>scorethings is a webapp I'm starting to help users "score things", or, give a thing a score.</p>
<p>
    <strong>What's a thing?</strong> Any Twitter user, hashtag, or tweet.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>What's a score?</strong> A score is a number of points (0-100) that YOU give that thing in a category.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>What's a category?</strong> It's something to help you easily describe the score you're giving a thing.
</p>
<p>
    scorethings provides you with <a href="#">10 different categories</a> to use when scoring a thing.
</p>
<p>
    You can give a thing as many scores as you want.  You can also share that score with your friends.
    <a href="#">Check out some scores that I made.</a>
