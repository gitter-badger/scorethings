# scorethings

[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/manuisfunny/scorethings.png)](https://travis-ci.org/manuisfunny/scorethings/)

This is a website that will allow you to rank and score the things you like (or dislike).

It is deployed to Heroku at http://www.scorethings.com  It will take a few seconds to load, because I'm hosting it with 1 web dyno and it sleeps after 1 hour of inactivity.

Its source code it hosted on GitHub at https://github.com/manuisfunny/scorethings.

The project website is at http://www.acargocultcoder.com/scorethings/.

I'm planning on blogging about my work on this project at my personal blog at http://www.acargocultcoder.com.
